### Strategy Logic:

1. **Calculate Relative Strength Index (RSI):**
   - RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements.
   - The formula for RSI is given by:
     \[ RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}} \]
   - It is calculated based on the closing prices of the stock.

2. **Calculate Bollinger Bands:**
   - Bollinger Bands are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average.
   - The upper band is calculated as \( \text{Basis} + \text{Multiplier} \times \text{Standard Deviation} \).
   - The lower band is calculated as \( \text{Basis} - \text{Multiplier} \times \text{Standard Deviation} \).

3. **Identify Buy and Sell Signals:**
   - Buy Signal: Generated when RSI is below 50 and the closing price is below the lower Bollinger Band.
   - Sell Signal: Generated when RSI is above 50 and the closing price is above the upper Bollinger Band.

4. **Simulate the Trading Strategy:**
   - For each data point, if a Buy Signal is generated and there is no existing position, buy the stock with the available capital.
   - If a Sell Signal is generated and there is an existing position, sell the entire position.

5. **Calculate Performance Metrics:**
   - Check if the strategy is profitable by comparing the final capital with the initial capital.
   - Calculate buy and sell counts.
   - Calculate profitability score, net profit, and return on investment (ROI).

6. **Visualize the Strategy:**
   - Plot the closing prices of the stock along with Buy and Sell signals.

### Example:

Let's consider a simplified example:

- Initial Capital: $50,000
- Buy Signal Condition: RSI < 50 and Close < Lower Bollinger Band
- Sell Signal Condition: RSI > 50 and Close > Upper Bollinger Band

```python
# Sample Data (Closing Prices)
data = [100, 110, 95, 120, 130, 90, 80, 110, 115, 125]

# Example Buy and Sell Signals
Buy_Signal = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Sell_Signal = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

# Example Trades
Trades = [('Buy', '2023-01-01', 95, 10), ('Sell', '2023-01-05', 130, 10)]
```

This example assumes a simple list of closing prices and manually generated buy and sell signals for illustration purposes. In a real-world scenario, these signals would be generated by the strategy based on the calculated RSI and Bollinger Bands.

The Gradio interface allows you to input a stock symbol, period, and interval to analyze the strategy's performance for a specific stock. The output includes metrics such as profitability, buy and sell counts, net profit, ROI, and a visual representation of the strategy's execution.
